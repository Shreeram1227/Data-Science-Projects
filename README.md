# Machine Learning Projects: Per Capita Income, 

Welcome to my machine-learning projects repository! This repository contains separate projects aimed at per capita income using various machine learning techniques.

## Project 1: Per capita income prediction

### Description
This project aims to use linear regression to predict the per capita income of Canada in 2020 based on the historical data from 1970 to 2016. The data is obtained from a CSV file that contains the year and the corresponding per capita income in Canadian dollars

### Techniques Used
-Importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, pickle and joblib.
-Loading the data from the csv file into a pandas dataframe.

-Exploring the data by plotting a scatter plot of year versus per capita income.

-Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

-Creating and fitting a linear regression model using sklearn.

-Data Visualization by using matplotlib

-Evaluating the model performance by calculating the mean absolute error, mean squared error and root mean squared error.

-Predicting the per capita income of Canada in 2020 using the model.
Saving the model using pickle and joblib methods for future use.

### Files
- `canada_per_capita_income.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `Linear_Regression_per capita income-Copy1`: Jupyter Notebook containing the linear regression implementation.
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Notebook for the multiple linear regression analysis.
- `gradient_descent.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the use of gradient descent.



## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective project folder (e.g., `Housing_Price_Prediction` or `Car_Price_Prediction`).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the code, methodology, and results.
4. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different techniques, and contribute to the projects.
